Hello, I'm Anthony

This repository contains five Python projects that I completed to earn the certificate "Data Analysis with Python" from FreeCodeCamp.org

The projects showcase the practical usage and application of data analysis using Python, including relevant libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Numpy, sns, and more.

Feel free to reach out for any question.
