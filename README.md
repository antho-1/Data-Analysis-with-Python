This repository contains five Python projects that I completed to earn the certificate "Data Analysis with Python" from FreeCodeCamp.org.

The projects showcase the practical usage and application of data analysis using Python, including relevant libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, Numpy, Seaborn, and more. Skills demonstrated include data extraction, cleaning, filtering, processing, and visualization.

Feel free to reach out for any question.
